# generator-ui5-add 
# A generator for adding assets to your ui5 project

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-ui5-add using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-ui5-add
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo ui5-add
```
## Good to know
The data for the yeoman generator is pulled from the [bestOfUI5](https://bestofui5.org/) website. 
Currently the following are supported, while others might come in the future depending on interest. The idea is all data is coming from bestofui5.
